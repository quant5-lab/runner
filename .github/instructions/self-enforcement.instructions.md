# 🚨 SELF-ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL 🚨

## ⚡ MANDATORY SELF-DISCIPLINE ⚡

### 🔴 AFTER EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:

- **STOP** → Check terminal output immediately
- **VERIFY** → Command succeeded or failed
- **CORRECT** → Fix any failures before proceeding

### 🔴 AFTER EVERY CLAIM:

- **PROVE** → Execute command to verify claim
- **SHOW** → Display exact evidence
- **ADMIT** → Acknowledge when wrong

### 🔴 WHEN CLAIMING COMPLETION:

- **STOP** → Never claim "task complete", "requirements fulfilled", "implementation complete"
- **DOUBLE-CHECK** → Re-read original requirements vs actual implementation
- **FOCUS FORWARD** → Current status (1 line), Next step (1 line), Remaining work (1 line)
- **NO BOASTING** → No paragraphs describing achievements - reinforces delusion

### 🔴 WHEN PROTOCOLS VIOLATED:

- **HALT** → Stop current action immediately
- **DECLARE** → "SELF-VIOLATION: [specific breach]"
- **RESTART** → Begin again with evidence

### 🔴 WHEN 15-MINUTE TIMEBOX EXCEEDED:

- **STOP** → Cease current debugging approach immediately
- **ACTIVATE** → Systematic debugging protocol: minimal setup → gradual transition → isolate exact delta
- **PROVE** → Each step works before adding next component
- **EVIDENCE-BASED ONLY** → No theories, claims, or assumptions without executable proof

### � WHEN EVIDENCE GAPS EXIST:

- **STOP** → Cease theorizing immediately
- **WRITE LOGS** → Add console.log/debug statements everywhere
- **CAPTURE LOGS** → Run tests/commands to collect actual evidence
- **ANALYZE LOGS** → Only make conclusions based on captured log evidence
- **NO SMART THEORIES** → Logs are smarter than assumptions

## �💀 AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS 💀

**IF I execute command without checking output → VIOLATION**
**IF I continue after failed command → VIOLATION**
**IF I make claim without proof → VIOLATION**
**IF I assume without evidence → VIOLATION**
**IF I spend >15min without systematic debugging → VIOLATION**
**IF I debug without strict evidence-based approach → VIOLATION**
**IF I theorize without logs → VIOLATION**
**IF I avoid writing debug logs → VIOLATION**
**IF I claim completion without double-checking requirements → VIOLATION**
**IF I boast about achievements instead of focusing on next steps → VIOLATION**

## 🔒 ZERO TOLERANCE 🔒

**NO EXPLANATIONS WITHOUT EXECUTION**
**NO PROGRESS WITHOUT PROOF**
**NO ASSUMPTIONS WITHOUT EVIDENCE**
**NO THEORIES WITHOUT LOGS**
**NO SMART GUESSING - LOGS ARE SMARTER**
**NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT USER ACCEPTANCE**
**NO ACHIEVEMENT BOASTING - FOCUS ON NEXT STEP**

**IMMEDIATE SELF-CORRECTION REQUIRED**
